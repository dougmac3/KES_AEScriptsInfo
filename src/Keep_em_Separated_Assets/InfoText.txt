Keep â€˜Em Separated is a workflow solution to separating position and scale dimensions in After Effects. KES can work on multiple 2D or 3D layers at a time and is totally non-destructive, meaning it will transfer existing keyframe animation to the separated dimensions, and back again if you choose to rejoin dimensions.
